# Rolling out to a fleet (Intune, Jamf, Homebrew)

Three steps for IT: put Squidbrake on every machine, connect each person's agents to the team's gateway, and lock the
agents so nobody can switch it off. One gateway and one `rules.yaml` then decide for every agent.

Before you start: run a team gateway (see [install.md](install.md)) and make one agent key per person in the
dashboard (*Team* → *Add someone*, type *AI agent*, *Works for* set to that person). Each agent key works for one person, so the
install is assigned per user, not once for all devices.

## 1. Install and connect

### Native installers (no Python needed)

Each release has a Windows MSI, a macOS .pkg (Apple silicon) and a Linux tarball, built by
[`.github/workflows/native.yml`](../.github/workflows/native.yml). They hold Squidbrake and everything it needs.
These links always give the newest one:

- Windows: https://github.com/batrapulkit/squidbrake/releases/latest/download/squidbrake-windows-x64.msi
- macOS (Apple silicon): https://github.com/batrapulkit/squidbrake/releases/latest/download/squidbrake-macos-arm64.pkg
- Linux: https://github.com/batrapulkit/squidbrake/releases/latest/download/squidbrake-linux-x64.tar.gz

- **Windows MSI.** Installs for one user, with no admin rights, into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Squidbrake`, and adds it
  to that user's PATH. With `URL` and `KEY` it also connects that person's agents, which makes it a one-line Intune
  Win32 app (install behavior: User):
  `msiexec /i squidbrake-VERSION-windows-x64.msi /qn URL=https://gateway.yourcompany.com KEY=gw_...`
- **macOS .pkg.** Installs into `/usr/local/lib/squidbrake` and links `/usr/local/bin/squidbrake`. Jamf can deploy it
  as a package. Then run `squidbrake connect all --url ... --key ...` as the user, for example with the Jamf script
  below.
- **Linux.** Unpack the tarball anywhere and put the `squidbrake` folder on the PATH.

The installers aren't code-signed yet. Installs through an MDM are fine, but opening one by hand shows a Windows
SmartScreen or macOS Gatekeeper warning.

### Windows: Microsoft Intune, with a script

[`packaging/mdm/intune-install.ps1`](../packaging/mdm/intune-install.ps1) installs Squidbrake for the signed-in user
and connects their Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, VS Code Copilot, Antigravity, Qwen Code, Factory Droid
and Kiro, and the MCP servers those agents use.

1. Wrap it as a Win32 app: `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe -c packaging\mdm -s intune-install.ps1 -o out`
2. Install command:
   `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File intune-install.ps1 -Url https://gateway.yourcompany.com -Key gw_...`
3. **Install behavior: User.** Squidbrake and the agents' settings live in the user's profile.
4. Detection rule: file `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\squidbrake.exe` exists.
5. Assign it to each person with their own key.

The install log is `%TEMP%\squidbrake-intune.log`.

### macOS: Jamf Pro

[`packaging/mdm/jamf-install.sh`](../packaging/mdm/jamf-install.sh) does the same on a Mac. Jamf runs scripts as
root, so the script installs as the person logged in at the console.

1. Add the script in *Settings* → *Scripts*.
2. In the policy, set parameter 4 to the gateway URL and parameter 5 to the person's agent key.
3. Triggers: *Recurring Check-in* and *Login*. If nobody is logged in, the script exits and runs again at the next
   login.

### macOS and Linux: Homebrew

```bash
brew install batrapulkit/tap/squidbrake
squidbrake connect all --url https://gateway.yourcompany.com --key gw_YOUR_AGENT_KEY
```

The formula is [`packaging/homebrew/squidbrake.rb`](../packaging/homebrew/squidbrake.rb).

## 2. Lock it

```bash
squidbrake lockdown --url https://gateway.yourcompany.com --out squidbrake-lockdown
```

This writes each agent's managed-settings file (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor) and a README saying where each
one goes on macOS, Linux and Windows. Push those files with the same MDM. Each agent then must run Squidbrake's hook,
and `--dangerously-skip-permissions` / `--yolo` are off.

## 3. Check

- `squidbrake doctor` on any machine says what is connected, what each hook doesn't see, and which MCP servers don't
  go through Squidbrake.
- The dashboard's *Settings* → *Agents across the team* lists every computer that reported, with agents and MCP
  servers that aren't connected yet.

## Not done yet

- **One install for every device.** Each machine needs its person's own key. An enrollment key that makes a key per
  person on first run isn't built yet.
- **Code signing.** The MSI and .pkg aren't signed yet: that needs a Windows code-signing certificate and an Apple
  Developer ID.
- **A .pkg for Intel Macs.** Intel Macs use Homebrew, pip or the one-line install.
